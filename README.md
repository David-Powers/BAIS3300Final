# Portfolio Project for BAIS:3300
This is a portfolio project for BAIS:3300, the purpose of this project is to creat our own website with a custom URL. This website is based off of a bootstrap template and has been updated and reworked to include all of my information. Some of the features of this site include sections about myself and my professional career. This site has all legal requiremts, cookie acceptance pop up, and is in full working order. This site serves as a more in depth and detailed version of my resume with working links to my social accounts. Check out the site linked in my profile under "my website."
